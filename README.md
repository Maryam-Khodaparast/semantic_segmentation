# semantic_segmentation
Welcome to the Semantic Segmentation project! This repository contains code and resources for performing semantic segmentation tasks using deep learning techniques, including the pretrained models DeepLabV3-FCN and U-Net.

Overview
Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves assigning a label to every pixel in an image, thereby segmenting the image into different meaningful regions. This technique plays a crucial role in various applications, including autonomous driving, image understanding, and medical imaging.

Features
Implementation of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models
Pretrained models (DeepLabV3-FCN and U-Net) for quick start and transfer learning
Efficient data preprocessing and augmentation techniques
Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance
